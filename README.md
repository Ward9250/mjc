# MJC
A python implementation of the Minimum Jump Cost dissimilarity algorithm.

This python code implements the dissimilarity algorithm devised by Joan Serra and Josep Lluis Arcos in 2012. MJC was shown to be computationally fast, and sometimes even more accurate than Dynamic Time Warp (DTW). You can read the paper here:
